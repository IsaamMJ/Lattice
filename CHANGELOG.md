# Changelog

All notable changes to Lattice are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- `/audit-sweep <root> auto` — opt-in auto-mode. When the `auto` token is present in the invocation, the skill automatically appends drafted HIGH/MEDIUM/RISK/WATCH checklist entries to `CLAUDE.md` and commits them at the end of the sweep. Saves one paste per sweep.

### Unchanged (deliberate)
- CRITICAL/BLOCKER findings are still NEVER auto-applied — they require explicit `fix <id>` or `fix all critical` from the user, regardless of mode. Methodology rule: "no auto-apply on architectural fixes."
- Default invocation (`/audit-sweep .` without `auto`) behaves exactly as v0.1: drafts the checklist block, waits for user `apply checklist` reply.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-02

Initial release.

### Added
- `/audit <doc-path>` — verifies every claim in a project doc against actual code with file:line evidence; distinguishes drift from deliberate removal; proposes contract-format rewrite.
- `/scale-audit <module-path>` — hunts horizontal-scaling killers (in-memory state, setInterval crons, in-process rate limiters, singleton assumptions); 4-tier verdict (BLOCKER / RISK / WATCH / OK).
- `/security-audit <module-path>` — hunts security exposures (auth gaps, signature bypass, secret leaks, IDOR, injection vectors); OWASP-tagged with attack scenarios + secure code examples; runs `npm audit` for dependency CVEs.
- `/audit-sweep <project-root>` — orchestrates all three audits across every module under `src/modules/`; aggregates into one master findings file with cross-cutting pattern detection.
- Methodology, contract-format spec, and reef postmortem in `docs/`.
- Sample audit findings + sample contract doc in `examples/`.
- `install.sh`, `update.sh`, `validate.sh` in `scripts/`.
- GitHub Actions workflow that validates plugin manifest + command frontmatter on every push.

### Notes
- Skills dispatch their heaviest step (claim verification, pattern hunting) to `oh-my-claudecode:executor` (Sonnet) when available; fall back to running in the main session if OMC is not installed.
- All audits stop at human-approval gates — no auto-applied fixes, no auto-commits.
